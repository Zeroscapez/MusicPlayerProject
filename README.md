# 🎵 MusicPlayer

A lightweight Windows desktop music player built with **.NET WinForms**, powered by **NAudio** for audio playback and **TagLib#** for metadata and album art extraction.

This project demonstrates clean architecture, managed audio handling (no COM interop), proper resource disposal, and event-driven playback control in a desktop application.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

MusicPlayer is a local audio playback application designed to provide a simple yet polished listening experience while showcasing:

- Modern .NET desktop development
- Audio handling with NAudio
- Metadata extraction with TagLib#
- Clean event-driven architecture
- Proper memory and resource management

The application automatically advances through a playlist, supports seeking, and displays embedded album artwork.

- 🎧 Play / Pause / Stop controls  
- ⏭ Previous / Next track navigation  
- 🔁 Automatic playback of the next track  
- 📂 Multi-file playlist support  
- 🖼 Album artwork extraction (with fallback image)  
- ⏱ Real-time progress tracking  
- 🎚 Volume control  
- 🖱 Click-to-seek progress bar

## 🏗 Technical Design

### Audio Engine — NAudio
NAudio is used instead of Windows Media Player to:

- Avoid COM interop dependencies
- Maintain a fully managed .NET codebase
- Ensure reliable builds
- Provide precise playback control

Playback progression is handled through the `PlaybackStopped` event with end-of-track detection logic to safely auto-advance the playlist.

### Metadata — TagLib#
TagLib# is used to extract:

- Embedded album artwork
- Track metadata

Album art is safely loaded and disposed to prevent memory leaks.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- .NET 6+  
- Windows Forms  
- NAudio  
- TagLib#
